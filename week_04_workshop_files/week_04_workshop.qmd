## The India TB Pathways dataset

*The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).*



```{python}
India = pd.read_csv('/Users/shargie/Desktop/Graph_courses_python/data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv')
```



```{python}
show(India)
```

## Bivariate plot showing the relationship between sex, and treatment initiation delays. 


```{python}
px.violin(India, y="Treatment initiation delay (in days)", x="Sex", color="Sex", box=True)
```



```{python}
max_delay = int(India["Treatment initiation delay (in days)"].max()) 

Median_delay = int(India["Treatment initiation delay (in days)"].median())
```

### Interpretation 

Males had a greater distribution in the number of days taken for treatment initiation. 
The max number of treatment delay days was seen among males with a total of  `{python} max_delay` days.
The median number of treatment delay days for both sexes was `{python} Median_delay` days.
