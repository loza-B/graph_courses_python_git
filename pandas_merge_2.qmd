## One-to-many joins

```{python}
people
```

```{python}
test_info_many
```

```{python}
pd.merge(people, test_info_many)
```

## Practice Q: Merging One-to-Many Crop Yields
Run the code below to print the two small dataframes:

```{python}
farm_info 
```

```{python}
crop_yields
```

If you use a merge() to join these datasets, how many rows will be in the final dataframe? Try to figure it out and then perform the join to see if you were right.
There will be 5 rows. 

```{python}
pd.merge(farm_info, crop_yields)
```


## Multiple Key Columns

```{python}
traffic_flow
```

```{python}
pollution_levels
```

```{python}
pd.merge(traffic_flow, pollution_levels, on="street_name", how="left") # need to know the street name and time of day. Two columns are needed to uniquely identify the key for each row. 
```


```{python}
pd.merge(traffic_flow, pollution_levels, on=["street_name", "time_of_day"])
```


## Practice Q: Calculate Oil Consumption per Capita
We have two datasets containing information about countries:

oil_consumption: Contains yearly oil consumption in tonnes
tidyr_population: Contains yearly population data

```{python}
# View the datasets
oil_consumption.sort_values(by=["country", "year"])
```

```{python}
tidyr_population.sort_values(by=["country", "year"])

```


Join these datasets using merge() with a left join. Since we want to match both country AND year, you’ll need to join on multiple columns. (You may notice that not all rows are matched. You can ignore this for now.)

After joining, create a new column called consumption_per_capita that calculates the yearly oil consumption per person (in tonnes).

Which country had the highest per capita oil consumption in 1995?

```{python}
Oil_consumption_merged = pd.merge(oil_consumption, tidyr_population, on=["country", "year"])
```

```{python}
Oil_consumption_merged["consumption_per_capita"] = Oil_consumption_merged ["oil_consump"]/Oil_consumption_merged["population"]

Oil_consumption_merged
```

## Key Mismatches

```{python}
people
```

```{python}
test_info_diff
```


```{python}
pd.merge(people, test_info_diff, on="name", how="inner")
```

```{python}
test_info_diff['name'] = test_info_diff['name'].str.title()
test_info_diff
```

```{python}
test_info_diff['name'].unique()
```


```{python}
people.merge(test_info_diff, on='name', how='inner')
```

```{python}
test_info_diff['name'] = test_info_diff['name'].str.strip()
test_info_diff
```


## Practice Q: Inner Join Countries
The following two datasets contain data for India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. However, an inner join of these datasets only returns 1 row.

```{python}
asia_countries
```

```{python}
asia_population
```

```{python}
pd.merge(asia_countries, asia_population)
```

What are the differences between the values in the key columns that would have to be changed before joining the datasets? Pay attention to capitalization and spelling.

Now, fix the mismatched values in the Country column and try the join again.

```{python}
asia_population['Country'] = asia_population['Country'].str.title().replace("Philipines", "Philippines")
asia_population
```

```{python}
pd.merge(asia_countries, asia_population)
```

## Key Mismatches: Oil Consumption Example

```{python}
oil_consumption
```

```{python}
tidyr_population
```

```{python}
oil_pop = pd.merge(
    oil_consumption, tidyr_population, on=["country", "year"], how="left"
).sort_values(["country", "year"])

oil_pop
```


```{python}
oil_countries = set(oil_consumption['country'].unique())
pop_countries = set(tidyr_population['country'].unique())
```

```{python}
# Shows us countries in oil but not in pop
missing_in_pop = oil_countries - pop_countries
missing_in_pop
```

```{python}
# Shows us countries in pop but not in oil
missing_in_oil = pop_countries - oil_countries
missing_in_oil
```

```{python}
# Side Note
set_1 = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
set_2 = set([2, 3, 4])
```

```{python}
set_1 - set_2
```


## Merging with Country Codes

```{python}
cc.convert("Nigeria", to='ISO3')
```

```{python}
oil_consumption['country_code'] = cc.convert(oil_consumption['country'], to='ISO3')
tidyr_population['country_code'] = cc.convert(tidyr_population['country'], to='ISO3')
```

```{python}
oil_countries = set(oil_consumption['country_code'].unique())
pop_countries = set(tidyr_population['country_code'].unique())
```

```{python}
oil_countries - pop_countries
```

## Practice Q: Merging Oil Consumption with Geographic Data
Run the code to view the two datasets.

The first, oil_2012, records the oil consumption for the year 2012:

```{python}
oil_2012
```

```{python}
country_regions
```


Join the two datasets using the country codes as the key. Then find the countries with the highest oil consumption in each continent. As a sanity check, your answer should include the US & China.

```{python}
oil_2012["country_code"] = cc.convert(oil_2012["country"], to="ISO3")


oil_2012_regions = oil_2012.merge(country_regions, on="country_code", how="left")

max_oil_by_continent = oil_2012_regions.loc[
    oil_2012_regions.groupby("continent")["oil_consump"].idxmax()
]

max_oil_by_continent[["country", "continent", "oil_consump"]]
```

oil_2012['country_code'] = cc.convert(oil_2012['country'], to='ISO3')


oil_2012_regions = oil_2012.merge(country_regions, on='country_code', how='left')

max_oil_by_continent = oil_2012_regions.loc[
    oil_2012_regions.groupby('continent')['oil_consump'].idxmax()
]

max_oil_by_continent[['country', 'continent', 'oil_consump']]

country	continent	oil_consump
21	Egypt	Africa	35300000
74	USA	Americas	778000000
13	China	Asia	484000000
62	Russia	Europe	145000000
2	Australia	Oceania	46100000
23 Wrap Up!
In this lesson, we explored several advanced concepts related to joining dataframes in Python:

One-to-Many Relationships: We learned how joins work when one observation in a dataframe corresponds to multiple observations in another dataframe, and how the data from the “one” side gets duplicated for each matching row on the “many” side.

Multi-Key Joins: We discovered how to join dataframes using multiple columns as keys (like combining street names with time of day), which is essential for maintaining data integrity when a single column isn’t enough to uniquely identify observations.

Key Mismatches: We explored common challenges in joining data from different sources, including:

Case sensitivity issues (e.g., “Alice” vs “alice”)
Trailing spaces
Spelling variations
Using standardized codes (like country codes) to ensure consistent matching
These skills are crucial for real-world data analysis, where data often comes from multiple sources and requires careful cleaning and preparation before it can be effectively combined.
